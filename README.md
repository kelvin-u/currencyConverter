## Technical Overview

- **React Framework:** A meticulously designed neural network with convolutional and recurrent layers trained on an ASL dataset for accurate recognition.
- **Real-time Processing:** Combines OpenCV and the neural network to instantly decipher ASL gestures, presenting them as letters and words.
